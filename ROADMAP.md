# Roadmap

This document outlines planned features and improvements for **spark-lineage-listener**.  
Contributions and feedback are welcome â€” feel free to open an issue or discussion.

## ðŸš§ In Progress
- [ ] Add support for **DataFrameWriter** APIs (e.g., `insertInto`, `save` with formats)
- [ ] Support raw SQL lineage tracking via `spark.sql`
- [ ] Support additional save methods (e.g., `saveAsTable`)
- [ ] Improve Spark plan â†’ SQL generation
    - Potentially capture the original SQL from Spark
- [ ] Add more lineage transports (starting with [OpenLineage](https://openlineage.io/))

---

## ðŸ”® Future Ideas
- [ ] Configurable lineage output (JSON, Avro, Protobuf, etc.)
- [ ] Even More transports (Kafka, REST endpoints, file sink)
- [ ] Release a stable version
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Example notebooks / demo pipelines
- [ ] Stress testing
---

## âœ… Done
- [x] Initial release: captures lineage events from SparkListener
- [x] Generates pseudo-SQL alongside lineage metadata
- [x] GitHub Actions setup for build & publish
